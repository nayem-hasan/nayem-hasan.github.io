  <p>We all familiar to websites. Everyday we visit many different websites like Facebook, Instagram, Google and many more. But what we don't know is how these websites are actually work. So we are going to learn that first.</p>
  
  <p>There are many kind of websites are there. The 3 main types of them are:</p>
  <div class="list">
  <ol>
    <li>Static website</li>
    <li>Responsive website </li>
    <li>Dynamic website</li>
    
  </ol>
  </div>
  
    <p>A static website have very limited facility. It can't change everytime. There content updating system are really hard. The can't make any changes to their site easily. Some of them are like a simple portfolio website, a simple informative website, a simple business page website, a simple news portal website ext.. </p>
    <p>A dynamic website is a website with many different options available and can change the content of the website easily. You can post different kind of content like picture, paragraph, a audio file or any kind of video file. Any kind of option you want can be put on this site. A very customizable website. 
    <p>A responsive website mean that you can visit the website from any kind of device you have and it will automatically fit to your device without any kind off hassle. It looks perfect. All it's fracture are easley accessable. It doesn't have any problem with your device. It shows every kind of details perfectly.</p>
    <p>How they made? That's the conclusion right? Now I'm going to describe this with some easy words. </p>
    <p>This websites are made with different tools, different languages ( Like we all talk and write in different languages in different countries) , and many kinds of softwares.</p>
    <p>Hold you heads. If you are not familiar to this kinds of things you may have a little headec after reading this.</p>
    <p>The most common thing in a website making is A Html file. What is it ? Hypertext markup language. A computer don't understand our normal talk. It has its own language, own formet to describe or understand. Html basically written in english language. But not as we write on paper or somewhere else. They write the words exactly like us writing but in a different style. So the computer can understand. </p>
    <p>Basically a website can make with a html file, a css file and a javascript file. You can also make with just a html file. What is this things right? Simply think about a house, how it's made? At first there is a land, then the structure are made, then the design it properly for his functions, then they color it , and put electronic functions. </p>
    <p> A website is made with same line. First we need a space and address it.like we visit " www.abcdef.com", then make a structure for our website, then we and desined it properly and add functions, then we put the wires to connect them and tell them how they'll work.</p>
    <p>let's see some off them how they work</p>
    <div class="list">
      
    <ul>
      <li>Html is the structure</li>
      <li>Css is the design</li>
      <li>JavaScript is the function</li>
      <li>server is the place</li>
      <li>And other languages are the wire for connection</li>
      
    </ul>
    
    </div>
    <div id="nextpage" class="">
